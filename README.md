## Name of the project
Code Refactor
## Overview
To refactor an existing site to make it more accessible for the people with disabilities and a codebase that follows accessibility standards.This will have a better User experience and ADA-compliant.
## The Challenge
Refactoring the code for an existing webpage by adding semantic HTML elements and eliminating non-semantic elements like div and span which defines no meaningful content.We need to make this web page more comprehensible by better defining the sections and sequential lay out of the pages.
CSS selectors and properties should be consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure. It should also maintain its current appearance despite any changes that were made to refactor the code.
## User Story
```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
